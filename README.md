IMPORTANT NOTES (In case Backend Service API Integration is required):

    1. The backend endpoint host url can be accessed using "process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL" property. An example is shown in index.js
    2. PLEASE USE THIS PROPERTY ("process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL") WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CALL A BACKEND API. ALSO DON'T CHANGE THIS PROPERTY ELSE THE APP WILL NOT BUILD PROPERLY AND YOUR SUBMISSION WILL NOT BE SCORED. 
    3. In order to start the server in your local system, please run one of the below commands based on your Operating system:
        - Windows (cmd.exe): set "REACT_APP_API_URL=<endpoint URL>" && yarn start
